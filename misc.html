    <blockquote cite="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/68539503"> 
        Brentford boss Thomas Frank was absolutely right. <strong>Kai Havertz</strong> had no right to be on the pitch when he scored the winner in Arsenal's 2-1 win over Brentford. The Germany international, having received a caution for throwing his elbow, elected to dive in the Brentford penalty area in order to try to seek a clear advantage. However, what was more troubling was that referee Robert Jones refused to do anything about it, even though the Brentford defenders were waving an imaginary card in the air in an attempt to bring the incident to his attention.

For Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta to then glorify the "manner of the win" in his post-match interview, having seen him gloating with Havertz at the end of the game, was a poor advert and only served to rub salt in Brentford's wounds.

Fortunately for Arsenal, White was on hand to play a pivotal role in Arsenal's victory over the Bees. Two beautifully floated crosses provided excellent assists in what was otherwise a rather grubby affair by the Gunners. If Arsenal are going to win the title please don't win it like this.
